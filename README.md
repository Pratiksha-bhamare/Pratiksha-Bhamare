## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm **Pratiksha**, a passionate and curious learner currently diving into the world of technology and design. I enjoy exploring different programming languages, sketching out ideas for apps, and slowly crafting my journey into tech as a **future designer**. Whether it's **writing Python scripts**, **coding in C/C++**, or **experimenting with web design**, I believe in learning by doing — and having fun while I'm at it.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- 💻 **Programming Languages:** C, C++, Python
- 🌍 **Web Basics:** HTML, CSS (just a little, still learning!)
- 🎯 **Interests:** UI/UX Design, App Prototyping, Creative Tech Projects

---

## 🌟 Goals

I dream of becoming a **designer** — one who crafts beautiful and functional interfaces for real-world apps. I'm eager to take on small projects, learn from scratch, and eventually build something that people can use every day.
